Code_challenges
===============

This was a timed challenge during my 10th week of coding at WDI. I didn't finish all the challenges, but 
I think I answered the ones I did pretty well. I tried to answer most questions two ways, if I didn't, I 
either ran out of time or didn't know the other solution.

Here is the link to the challenge:
